#### **The procedure for using simulator is as follows:**

### Expt. : Study of Strain Gauge

### **Aim:** To study the working principle of strain gauge using strain gauge simulator.

#### **Step by step Procedure:**
1. First select the material of the strain gauge from the available drop down menu.
2. Select the value of input voltage V for the bridge in which strain gauge is connected.
3. Select the strain gauge resistance in ohms.
4. Select the bridge configuration. Observe the connection diagram, by changing the selected configuration.
5. Select the gauge factor value from available drop down menu.
6. Click on **Configure** tab. The system is configured once the user confirm the values.
7. Now the weight tab gets enabled. Select the weight in Kg to be applied to the cantilever beam. Now the value of Rg is displayed.
8. Enter the expected **output value (e) in millivolts**. For calculations of output, click on **formula** tab.
9. Using formula, calculate the value of the output voltage and enter the answer in the box provided (0.00 format). Submit the answer using submit button.
10. If your calculation is correct you will get the message accordingly. If not you need to repeat the calculations.
11. Change the value of **weight** and repeat the steps 7 to 10.
12. Minimum three calculations are necessary to plot the graph. After three calculations, the **Plot** tab will be activated.
13. Click on **Plot** to see the graph. Study the graph of output voltage variation when weight is changed.
14. Hide the graph and repeat the experiment by varying the values of inputs or bridge types. Observe the graphs. For this use **' Next set of values'** tab which is enabled now. Otherwise go to next level by clicking **'Level 2'** enabled tab.

### **Level 2**
#### **Study of effect of change in position of weight applied on Strain Gauge performance**

1. When you move from level 1 to level 2, the configuration and selected weight remains same.
2. Now you can select the position of the weight attached to the beam. Originally the distance between strain gauge and the applied weight is 16 cm. Now if 14 cm position is selected the distance is reduced by 2 cm i.e. the distance between strain gauges fixed on the beam and the applied weight is 14 cm. You can observe this change in available diagram.
3. **Observe** the displayed output value. Compare this value with previous value. Refer to **formula** tab for calculations.
4. Minimum three calculations are necessary to plot the graph. After three calculations the **Plot** tab will be activated.
5. Click on **Plot** to see the graph. Study the graph of output voltage variation when position is changed. Observe the graph carefully.
6. Hide the graph and move on to next level by clicking on **'Level3'** tab.

### **Level 3**
#### **Study of effect of change in temperature on the performance of Strain Gauge**

1. When you move from level 2 to level 3, all the parameters including the position of the weight for level 1 and level 2 freeze. The user can now select the **temperature** to which strain gauges are exposed i.e. ambient temperature.

2. Select the temperature in oC from the drop down menu. The reference temperature considered for previous level calculations is 20 oC.
3. **Observe** the displayed value of Rg i.e. Resistance of strain gauge. Compare this value with previous value. Refer to **formula** tab for calculations.
4. Minimum three calculations are necessary to plot the graph. After three calculations the **Plot** tab will be activated.
5. Click on **Plot** to see the graph. Study the graph of Rg value variation with change in temperature. After completion of all the parts, you can proceed to Post Test to find if you have understood all aspects of the experiment.
